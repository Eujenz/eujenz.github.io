## SMT-Wafer Prep 掌握晶圓製備技術

1. Describe how raw silicon is refined into semiconductor-grade silicon.

The refinement of raw silicon into semiconductor-grade silicon involves several key steps:

- Metallurgical-Grade Silicon (MGS) Production: Silicon dioxide ($SiO_2$) is reduced with carbon at high temperatures to produce silicon and carbon monoxide. This process creates MGS, which has a purity of about 98%:
        $SiO_2 + C → Si + CO$.

- Chemical Purification: The MGS undergoes a chemical reaction with hydrogen chloride ($HCl$) to produce trichlorosilane ($SiHCl_3$), a silicon-bearing gas:
        $Si + 3HCl → SiHCl_3 + H_2$.
- Siemens Process: In this process, trichlorosilane is decomposed with hydrogen to produce pure semiconductor-grade silicon (SGS). This is achieved through the reaction:
        $2SiHCl_3 + 2H_2 → 2Si + 6HCl$.

This method provides extremely pure silicon, which is used to fabricate high-quality wafers for semiconductor devices​.


2. Explain the crystal structure and growth method for producing monocrystalline silicon.

- Crystal Structure: Silicon typically adopts a face-centered cubic (FCC) diamond structure, which is essential for its electrical and mechanical properties. Monocrystalline silicon has a continuous crystal lattice throughout the entire material, unlike polycrystalline silicon, which has multiple smaller crystals (grains). The monocrystalline structure is essential for high-performance semiconductor devices​.

- Growth Methods:
    - Czochralski (CZ) Method: In this method, a seed crystal is dipped into molten silicon, and the crystal is slowly pulled out while rotating. This process allows the growth of large monocrystalline silicon ingots. However, some impurities, such as oxygen, may be introduced from the quartz crucible used in this method.
    - Float-Zone (FZ) Method: This method does not use a crucible, reducing the possibility of contamination. The silicon rod is melted using an RF coil, and the crystal grows without contact with the container, producing a highly pure monocrystalline structure​.

3. Discuss the major defects in silicon crystals.

Three main types of defects can occur in silicon crystals:

- Point Defects: These defects occur at the atomic level and include vacancies (where atoms are missing) and interstitials (extra atoms squeezed into the crystal lattice). These small-scale defects can impact the electrical properties of the silicon.

- Dislocations: Dislocations are disruptions in the regular stacking of atoms in the crystal. These can occur due to uneven cooling or mechanical stress during the crystal growth process, leading to areas where the atomic planes are misaligned​.

- Gross Defects: These larger-scale defects, such as crystal slips and twin planes, are introduced by thermal or mechanical shocks during the crystal growth process. Gross defects can significantly affect the overall structural integrity of the wafer​.

4. Outline and describe the basic process steps for wafer preparation, starting from a silicon ingot and finishing with a wafer.

The preparation of wafers from a silicon ingot involves the following steps:

- Ingot Shaping: The silicon ingot is ground to a uniform diameter to ensure proper slicing.
- Wafer Slicing: The shaped ingot is sliced into thin wafers using a wire saw or internal diameter saw.
- Lapping: The wafer undergoes mechanical lapping to remove surface imperfections caused by slicing.
- Etching: Chemical etching is used to remove any surface damage from the mechanical processes.
- Polishing: The wafer is polished on both sides to achieve a flat, smooth surface that is essential for device fabrication.
- Cleaning: The wafers are cleaned to remove any contaminants or particles.
- Inspection and Packaging: The finished wafers are inspected for defects, and those that meet specifications are packaged for further processing​.

5. State and discuss seven quality measures for wafer suppliers.

Wafer suppliers must ensure that their products meet the following seven quality measures:

- Physical Dimensions: Wafers must adhere to specific diameter and thickness specifications.
- Flatness: The wafer surface must be flat to ensure uniform layer deposition and lithography.
- Microroughness: The microscopic surface roughness of the wafer must be minimized to prevent electrical issues during device fabrication.
- Oxygen Content: Excessive oxygen can affect the electrical properties of the silicon, so oxygen content must be controlled.
- Crystal Defects: Minimizing crystal defects, such as dislocations and vacancies, is crucial for the reliability of the devices.
- Particles: The presence of particles on the wafer surface can lead to defects during subsequent fabrication steps.
- Bulk Resistivity: The electrical resistivity of the wafer must be consistent, which depends on the doping concentration and uniformity​.

6. Explain what epitaxy is and why it is important for wafers.

Epitaxy refers to the process of growing a thin, ordered monocrystalline layer of silicon on top of an existing silicon wafer. This "epi-layer" replicates the crystal structure of the base wafer and can be doped differently from the substrate to achieve specific electrical characteristics.

Importance:
- Epitaxy allows for precise control of the electrical properties of the silicon, enabling the production of high-performance semiconductor devices.
- The epitaxial layer is used in applications where improved control over doping and reduced defect density are required.
- This process is essential for advanced devices such as CMOS transistors, where high-purity, low-defect surfaces are necessary​.
